      <title>A guide to Grace Hopper for the rare non-recruiting student</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the weeks leading up to Grace Hopper this October, I wasn&#39;t sure why I was going. The emphasis on recruiting is certainly there, and girls who were attending with me from Northwestern were&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;talks&#34;&gt;Talks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my first day at the conference, I mainly followed the AI track for talks, since this aligned most my research interests. Then I realized that this is really different from an academic conference, where talks present state-of-the-art research with a meaningful contribution. I kept being surprised that the talks here are given by people in industry instead of in academia, where the goal is building a successful product rather than advancing the state of human knowledge or capacity of computation. But what&#39;s special about Grace Hopper is that their talks span all areas and applications of technology, which isn&#39;t true of an NLP conference or ML conference. I found it much more valuable to view the talks at this conference as a way to learn about topics that I wouldn&#39;t otherwise be exposed to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve often been intimidated at academic conferences to ask questions, so asking them here was a really good exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;university-booths&#34;&gt;University booths&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many universities have booths with graduate school admissions officers who will be really excited to hear that you&#39;re interested in applying! Some may have application fee waivers for those who stop by and chat. Prepare some questions to ask about the application and what it&#39;s like being a PhD student at their school, and be ready to jot down quick notes. Chat with current PhD students who are around the booth! It&#39;s a good idea to have some copies of your CV on you. You can ask an admissions officer if you would be a competitive applicant. You can also simply ask, &amp;quot;If I leave a copy of this with you, is there any chance it will make it to someone?&amp;quot; Most will answer honestly. Some took a picture of my CV and emailed it right away to a professor I was interested in, and some wrote the names of professors on the CV for later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;poster-session&#34;&gt;Poster session&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a nestled-away poster session in the career fair room! I found it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found it really grounding to talk about graduate admissions with people. Speaking my intentions into reality, verbalizing my questions, and receiving feedback on my candidacy helped me feel more comfortable with preparing my application. Before this, grad school applications are not the subject of conversation I have with any of my peers, as recruiting seems to be the universal language among my cohort.&lt;/p&gt;
