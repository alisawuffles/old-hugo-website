Researchers have augmented data with techniques such as transposition, which loses compositional information specific to its original key, or by extracting multiple short segments from each piece, which loses long-term coherence. We propose an alternative method which augments a dataset limited in training examples by using an existing model’s generated output weighted by a hand-crafted score function, to feed back as new training data to update the model. We try this method with DeepBach, a model trained to generate chorales in the style of Bach, a task where gold data is inherently limited to the 389 chorales Bach wrote in his lifetime. While this is a large output for a single composer, it is not enough for training deep models. Our hypothesis is that training on high-quality generated output is more useful than training on simple transformations of the same music.\nThis is very much a work in progress and we hope to use our class project as an opportunity to be extra creative, so please let us know if you have any thoughts or suggestions!\n","date":1572566400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574750563,"objectID":"5b51174e7df864c1a7c10e2389885074","permalink":"https://alisawuffles.github.io/project/deepbach/","publishdate":"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/deepbach/","section":"project","summary":"Using heuristic evaluations of generated music to train a Bach chorale generator on high-quality generations","tags":["research","class project","ongoing","music"],"title":"Augmentative generation for Bach chorales","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Developing a neural language model that generates definitions and paraphrases of noun compounds (e.g. “caramel popcorn”).
