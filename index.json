Researchers have augmented data with techniques such as transposition, which loses compositional information specific to its original key, or by extracting multiple short segments from each piece, which loses long-term coherence. We propose an alternative method which augments a dataset limited in training examples by using an existing model’s generated output weighted by a hand-crafted score function, to feed back as new training data to update the model. We try this method with DeepBach, a model trained to generate chorales in the style of Bach, a task where gold data is inherently limited to the 389 chorales Bach wrote in his lifetime. While this is a large output for a single composer, it is not enough for training deep models. Our hypothesis is that training on high-quality generated output is more useful than training on simple transformations of the same music.\nThis is very much a work in progress and we hope to use our class project as an opportunity to be extra creative, so please let us know if you have any thoughts or suggestions!\n","date":1559347200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573284919,"objectID":"7fefbd5f15cf253f403e8af87f385e15","permalink":"https://alisawuffles.github.io/project/deepbach/","publishdate":"2019-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/deepbach/","section":"project","summary":"Using heuristic evaluations of generated music to train a Bach chorale generator on high-quality generations","tags":["research","class project"],"title":"Augmentative generation for Bach chorales","type":"project"},{"authors":["Michael Chen","Mike D'arcy","Alisa Liu","Jared Fernandez","Doug Downey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559347200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573272765,"objectID":"b9966e05ba0d9a68862f41435e4eef65","permalink":"https://alisawuffles.github.io/publication/codah/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/codah/","section":"publication","summary":"An adversarially-constructed dataset for common sense QA, collected from Northwestern ML students!","tags":["common sense","dataset","question-answering"],"title":"CODAH: An Adversarially Authored Question-Answer Dataset for Common Sense","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Produced an adversarially generated commonsense question-answer dataset, using a novel question acquisition procedure where workers author questions designed to target weaknesses of state-of-the-art neural QA systems.\n","date":1559347200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573270469,"objectID":"28c0d7026f82ce5681f89663bcfcf7e7","permalink":"https://alisawuffles.github.io/project/codah/","publishdate":"2019-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/codah/","section":"project","summary":"Introduced an adversarially generated commonsense question-answer dataset","tags":["research"],"title":"Common sense QA dataset","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Developing a neural language model that generates definitions and paraphrases of noun compounds (e.g. “caramel popcorn”).
